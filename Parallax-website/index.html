            The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is about the
            struggle to get rid of the ring that will change the fate of the
            world. The last of the rings, which has brought nothing but blood to
            the lands of Middle-earth, appears hundreds of years after its
            production. Frodo, unaware of what the ring entrusted to him by his
            uncle is capable of, is horrified by what the wizard Gandalf tells
            him. The only way to get rid of this ring and the wars to come is to
            destroy it in order to prevent Sauron from gathering his power. A
            team of self-sacrificing warriors is assembled to take the ring to
            Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed. A long and arduous
            journey begins. The fate of Middle-earth is in the hands of these
            people.

            One ring will rule them all. One ring will find them. One ring will
            bring them all together and bind them all together in the darkness.
            J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings. In the first chapter of
            J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece The Lord of the Rings, a shy young
            hobbit named Frodo Baggins inherits a simple gold ring. He knows
            that the ring has a secret power, but he does not know that only he
            holds the secret to the salvation or enslavement of the whole world.
            Together with a wizard, an elf, an elf, a dwarf, two humans and
            three loyal hobbit friends, Frodo must become the greatest hero the
            world has ever seen to save his beloved country and his friends.

            The Two Towers tells the story of each member of the Fellowship of
            the Ring and what happened to them after the brotherhood was broken.
            In groups, our heroes will have adventures in the most dangerous
            places of Middle-earth, meeting new tribes and long-forgotten
            civilizations. Can the other hobbits survive the Urukhai as Frodo
            and Sam, with an old friend(!) as a forced collaborator, try to take
            the One Ring into the heart of the enemy? Will Saruman, who has
            turned to the dark side, get away with it? What are the chances of
            our heroes succeeding without Gandalf? The Two Towers, which will
            tell the story of the coming of the great darkness and the events
            leading up to the War of the Ring, is undoubtedly one of the most
            exciting parts of the trilogy.Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's immortal
            work of 3 books, The Two Towers, the second of the 3 films shot all
            together as a result of more than a year of filming, is being edited
            and final touches are being made to be released in December 2002.

            One ring will rule them all. One ring will find them. One ring will
            bring them all together and bind them all together in the darkness.
            In the final chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece The Lord
            of the Rings, as the armies gather for a final battle that will
            decide the fate of the world and the forces of Light and Darkness
            battle each other to decide the outcome, a member of the Fellowship
            of the Ring is revealed to be the noble heir to the King of Men. But
            the only hope for victory over evil is the brave hobbit Frodo,
            accompanied by his faithful friend Sam and the foul and wretched
            Gollum. Frodo sets out into the deepest depths of the dark heart of
            Mordor to achieve the seemingly impossible goal of destroying the
            Ring of Power.
